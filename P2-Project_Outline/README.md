## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will give users the ability to combine the leftover amounts of currency on various gift cards to calculate their worth as well as track the spend on these cards for the user. They will be able to see how much they spent and how much they have left to spend. User will find this useful in adding a few extra bucks to their wallet instead of wasting finaces that could have helped with other things. This idea came from my sister saying she wished she had a way to track or use the money on her dozens of leftover gift cards without having to add more money to them.
